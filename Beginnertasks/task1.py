# 1. Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it.
# Now check the data type of this variable.
pi = 22/7
print("Value of pi:", pi)
typ=type(pi)
print("Data type of pi:", typ)



# 2. Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you  see.

# for = 4
# print("Value of for value:", for_value)

#for cannot be used as a variable because it is a reserved keyword in python.



# 3. Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in
# different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3
# years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100


# years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100
principal = 1500
rate_of_interest = 6
time = 3
simple_interest = (principal * rate_of_interest * time) / 100
print("Simple Interest:", simple_interest)
